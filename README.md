# Python Air – Airline Data Management & Visualization

**Python Air** is a simulated data analytics tool for a fictional budget airline. Built in Python, this project parses and visualizes historical flight data to help the airline’s internal analytics team track customer trips, view airport traffic, and filter flight segments by specific search criteria.

## Features

- **Data Import:** Efficiently loads structured data from CSV files into custom class hierarchies (Airports, Customers, Trips, and Flight Segments).
- **Filtering Engine:** Enables dynamic filtering of flight segments based on customer ID, departure/arrival airport, date range, and more.
- **Visualization:** Displays filtered flight data in a structured, user-friendly format to support historical analysis.
- **Trip Management:** Supports backend functionality like canceling a customer's trip to simulate operational tasks.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Built with extensibility and future development in mind using clean, modular classes.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- CSV parsing
- OOP (classes and inheritance)
- Custom filtering logic
- *(Optional)* matplotlib / tkinter for visualization (if included)

## Dataset Structure

This project uses mock datasets for:
- Airports
- Customers
- Flight Segments
- Trip History (2019)
